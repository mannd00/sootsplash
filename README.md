# SootSplash

Welcome to our Server!

sootsplash.csci2461.com

Since our classes can have shared access to this server host. Thought we should have some documentation to facilitate this colab.

## Ports

Please lets everyone know what ports you will be using eg. if multiple groups are using port 80 for web host, gonna have a bad time. Use a non-standard port.
Or get your own host!

## SSL

Once we get SSL Encryption setup, don't break it please!

Suggested we use LetsEncrypt?
